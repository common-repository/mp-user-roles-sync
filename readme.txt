Automatically synchronized lists for MailPoet based on user roles.

== Description ==

[MailPoet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wysija-newsletters/) is an awesome newsletter plugin. Currently, it doesn't have a way to synchronize lists by user roles, it only creates on 'WordPress Users' list with all your users.

This plugin extends the functionality of MailPoet by creating additional automatically synced lists, one for each WordPress User Role on your site.

When changing the role of a user, the lists should be automatically updated.

You can edit and delete any of these lists (although you can't remove subscribers, as with the 'WordPress Users' list). You can recreate them by clicking the 'Re-Sync Role Lists' button on the edit lists page. 

== Installation ==

1. [Install your plugin as you would any WordPress plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. When activated, the plugin should automatically create new lists and populate them. Visit your MailPoet edit lists page to view them.

4. New users should automatically be added to the right role list. You can also sync them via the 'update' link under each list, or via the Sync Role Lists at the top. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Your lists page now has role-based lists, yay!
